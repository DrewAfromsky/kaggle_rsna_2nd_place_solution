# Kaggle RNSA Inracranial 2nd Place Solution Breakdown

My notebooks to accompany the blog posts about the 2nd place Kaggle RSNA winners to help me understand theire solution

In the next post I will dive into their code, but first check out Darragh and Dmitry’s work here for yourself:

- [kaggle discussion of their solution](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-intracranial-hemorrhage-detection/discussion/117228)
- [accompanying youtube explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=&v=U7WjTtGSOKA)
- [code on github](https://github.com/darraghdog/rsna)


After performing dismally in the Kaggle RSNA Intracranial Haemorrhage Competition thanks to a pig-headed strategy 
relying on  brute force (via an expensive cloud instance) and too little thinking I resolved to see what the 
winners had done right. This series posts will cover what I learned looking at the code shared by the 2nd 
placed team, who’s solution I found both approachable and innovative, hope you enjoy.
