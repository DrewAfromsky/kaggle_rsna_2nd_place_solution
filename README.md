# Kaggle RNSA Inracranial 2nd Place Solution Breakdown

Notebooks to accompany the blog posts about the 2nd place Kaggle RSNA winners: https://github.com/darraghdog/rsna 

After performing dismally in the Kaggle RSNA Intracranial Haemorrhage Competition thanks to a pig-headed strategy 
relying on  brute force (via an expensive cloud instance) and too little thinking I resolved to see what the 
winners had done right. This series posts will cover what I learned looking at the code shared by the 2nd 
placed team, whoâ€™s solution I found both approachable and innovative, hope you enjoy.
